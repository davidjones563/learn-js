## Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development. It enables you to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. JavaScript can be executed in the browser, on the server (using Node.js), and even in other environments like mobile apps or desktop applications.

To start learning JavaScript, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Knowledge of programming concepts like variables, functions, and control flow will also be beneficial.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To write and run JavaScript code, you need a code editor and a browser. Here are some popular options:

- **Code Editors**: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom
- **Browsers**: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge

Once you have a code editor and a browser installed, you're ready to write your first JavaScript code!

## Basic JavaScript Concepts

JavaScript has several foundational concepts that you need to understand. These concepts include variables, data types, operators, control flow, and functions. Here's an example that demonstrates some of these concepts:

```javascript
// Declare a variable and assign a value
let name = 'John';

// Print a message using the variable
console.log('Hello, ' + name + '!');

// Control flow with if-else statement
if (name === 'John') {
  console.log('Welcome, John!');
} else {
  console.log('Welcome, stranger!');
}

// Function declaration
function square(number) {
  return number * number;
}

// Function call
console.log(square(5)); // Output: 25
